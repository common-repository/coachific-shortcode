**Example:** 
`[coachific userhash="z7w4r7" login="false"]`

The userhash value is obtained from Coachific and can be specified in the shortcode for a specific user or for multiple users leave the shortcode blank and manage the user hash on the Wordpress user manager.

`[coachific userhash="" login="false"]`

**What is Coachific?**

[Coachific](http://coachific.com) is personal trainer software that enables you to get better results with dozens, even hundreds, of people while working smarter, growing your business, and living life on your own terms.

**Why is this useful?**

Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript code to embed Coachific onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the "HTML" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will work either way and the shortcode supports multiple users, thereby allowing seamless integration of Coachific with Wordpress.
